# TLE Eliminators C++ Solutions

Welcome to my repository of C++ solutions for the TLE Eliminators competitive programming sheet. This project documents my journey through various problem difficulty ratings, focusing on optimizing solutions to eliminate Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors.

## About TLE Eliminators

TLE Eliminators CP-31 is a curated list of competitive programming problems designed to help programmers improve their problem-solving skills and code optimization techniques. The sheet covers a wide range of difficulty ratings, typically from 800 to 1600.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by difficulty rating:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 800
â”œâ”€â”€ 900
â”œâ”€â”€ 1000
â”œâ”€â”€ 1100
â”œâ”€â”€ 1200
â”œâ”€â”€ 1300
â”œâ”€â”€ 1400
â”œâ”€â”€ 1500
â””â”€â”€ 1600
```

Each directory contains solutions to problems of that particular difficulty rating.

## Solution Format

Each solution file follows this naming convention:
`problem_name.cpp`

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning journey, suggestions for optimizations or alternative solutions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own implementations and may not always be the most optimal. The primary goal is learning and improvement. Always strive to solve problems on your own before referring to solutions.
